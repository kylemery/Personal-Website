  <div class="descrip-text">
    <p>During my time at the Algonquin Students' Association, I was able to work on an amazing project with the Pride Centre. This was to be monthly educational videos to help people understand and normalize different LGBTQ+ words. I came up with the name (a mix between "queer" and "words"), while Jordan Wiens came up with the look oand feel. He also filmed all of the videos. I also animated all of the motion graphics, and acted as an assistant to Jordan while filming.</p>

      <p>The logo for Qwords was created to be fun and playful. We wanted these videos to come off as friendly and educational, with gender-neutral colours and soft shapes.</p>
